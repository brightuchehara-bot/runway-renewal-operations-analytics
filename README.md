Operations analytics project using SQL and Python to optimize resource utilization and scheduling for a $60M airport runway renewal.
# Runway Renewal Operations Analytics

## Overview
This project demonstrates how SQL and Python can be used to analyze operational data from a large-scale infrastructure project, specifically a $60M airport runway renewal.

The goal was to improve visibility into equipment utilization, labor allocation, and production throughput to support data-driven scheduling and resource planning.

## Tech Stack
- SQL
- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Excel (source data modeling)

## Project Structure
- `data/` – Raw and processed operational datasets
- `sql/` – SQL queries for KPI aggregation
- `notebooks/` – Python workflows for cleaning and analysis
- `reports/` – Executive-ready analytics summaries

## Key Metrics
- Equipment utilization rate
- Daily production output
- Crew utilization
- Work-zone throughput

## Outcome
This analysis provided actionable insights into operational bottlenecks and resource inefficiencies, enabling improved schedule adherence and operational decision-making.

## Notes
Data is anonymized and/or simulated to demonstrate analytics workflows.
